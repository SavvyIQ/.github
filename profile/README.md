## What We Do

SavvyIQ provides enterprise-grade APIs for business entity resolution and intelligence. Our AI agents research and resolve business entities in real-time, going beyond static databases to find hard-to-locate businesses with minimal web presence.

### Core APIs

- **Entity Resolution API** - AI agents research entities from unstructured data
- **Business Intelligence API** - Comprehensive business data enrichment  
- **Domain Intelligence API** - Operating entity identification from domains

## Key Differentiators

### Government-Verified Foundation
Government records provide the foundation, but AI agents research beyond static databases to find entities with minimal online presence.

### Global Coverage, No Boundaries
Direct integrations with government registrars worldwide, plus AI consensus models for restricted jurisdictions ensure truly global entity coverage.

### AI Agent-Driven Research
When cached data isn't available, AI agents conduct real-time web research using multiple tools and sources, similar to human researchers.
